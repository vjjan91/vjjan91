### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am an avian ecologist studying the community ecology of birds along tropical mountains. My research encompasses the fields of bioacoustics, historical ecology, and citizen science (Please see links to different projects below).

### Citizen Science

[![eBird Occupancy Modelling](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-eBird_Occupancy_Modelling-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/vjjan91/eBirdOccupancy) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6501805.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6501805)

This study uses data from eBird to parse climatic and land cover influences on bird occupancy within a tropical biodiversity hotspot. This manuscript is now published in [![Ecography](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ecography-blue?style=flat-square)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.06075).

### Conservation Bioacoustics

[![Restoration](https://img.shields.io/badge/Github-Restoration-blue?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/vjjan91/acoustics-westernGhats)

This study uses acoustic data to examine the impacts of active forest restoration on vocalizing biodiversity in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. This manuscript is now published in [![Biological Conservation](https://img.shields.io/badge/BiologicalConservation-blue?style=flat-square)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320723001726).

### Historical Ecology

Ongoing analyses that asks how a century of climatic and landscape changes have impacted bird communities in the Nilgiri hills of the Western Ghats.
