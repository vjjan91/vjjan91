### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am an avian ecologist studying the community ecology of birds along tropical mountains. My research encompasses the fields of bioacoustics, historical ecology and citizen science (Please see links to different projects below).

### Citizen Science

This study uses data from eBird to parse climatic and land cover influences on bird occupancy within a tropical biodiversity hotspot (now published in _Ecography_).   

### Bioacoustics

This study uses acoustic data to examine the impacts of active forest restoration on vocalizing biodiversity in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot. (this manuscript is in _review_). 

### Conservation Funding

Using a large database of grants awarded for biodiversity conservation, our study shows that conservation funding does not track the drivers of biodiversity loss (*In review*).
